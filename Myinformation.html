            The inspiration for becoming a developer can be found in many different places, from our household environments, to school, work, or even simply interacting with computers regularly.

One of our students from Nigeria, Taiwo Coker, shared that she was inspired to explore software development by using the UBER app while working as an UBER driver.

“I was interested in learning how to build apps that will solve problems for people.”
For Mily Puente of Mexico, her inspiration also came from her work. “I worked as an IT recruiter for almost 6 years, and after a good thinking process I decided to change careers to try this.”

Multiple students mentioned the role that family members played in inspiring them to become a software developer. Cecilia Benitez of Paraguay said her father inspired her to become a software developer, and Ana Paula Hübner of Brazil also said it was a parent that had inspired her. For Amita Roy of India, her husband inspired her to become a software developer.
