        <h1>Flex vs inline-flex</h1>
        <cite
          >This pen is understand difference between flex and inline-flex.
          Follow along to understand this basic property of css</cite
        >
        <ul>
          <li>
            Follow #1 in CSS:
            <ul>
              <li>Comment <code>display: flex</code></li>
              <li>Un-comment <code>display: inline-flex</code></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Hope you would have understood till now. This is very similar to
            situation of `inline-block` vs `block`. Lets go beyond and
            understand usecase to apply learning. Now lets play with
            combinations of A, B, C & D by un-commenting only as instructed:
            <ul>
              <li>
                A with D -- does this do same job as
                <code>display: inline-flex</code>. Umm, you may be right, but
                not its doesnt do always, keep going !
              </li>
              <li>A with C</li>
              <li>A with C & D -- Something wrong ? Keep going !</li>
              <li>B with C</li>
              <li>
                B with C & D -- Still same ? Did you learn something ?
                inline-flex is useful if you have space to occupy in parent of 2
                flexboxes <code>.flex-con</code>. That's the only usecase
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
